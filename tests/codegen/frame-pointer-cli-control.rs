/*
Tests that the frame pointers can be controlled by the CLI. We find aarch64-apple-darwin useful
because of its icy-clear policy regarding frame pointers (software SHALL be compiled with them),
e.g. <https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/writing-arm64-code-for-apple-platforms> says:

* The frame pointer register (x29) must always address a valid frame record. Some functions —
  such as leaf functions or tail calls — may opt not to create an entry in this list.
  As a result, stack traces are always meaningful, even without debug information.

//! TODO: T-compiler needs to make a decision about whether or not rustc should defer to the CLI
//! when given the -Cforce-frame-pointers flag, even when the target platform mandates it for ABI!
//! Considerations:
//!
//! - Many Rust fn, if externally visible, may be expected to follow ABI by tools or even asm code!
//!   This can potentially make it unsound to generate ABI-incorrect (without frame pointers) code.
//! - Some platforms (illumos?) seem to have unwinding irretrievably break without frame-pointers:
//!   - <https://smartos.org/bugview/OS-7515>
//!   - <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b71e8cbaf2c7cae4d36898fff1d0ba19d9233082/compiler/rustc_target/src/spec/base/illumos.rs#L35>
//! - The code in more sophisticated backtrace and unwinding routines is notorious "dark magic"
//!   that is poorly documented, understood by few, and prone to regressions for strange reasons.
//!   Such unwinders in-theory allow using uwutables instead of frame pointers, but if they break?
//!   For better or worse, these problems are often mended by forcing frame pointers:
//!   - <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/123733>
//!   - <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/104388>
//!   - <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/97723>
//!   - <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/43575>
//! - Those 32-bit x86 platforms that reputedly benefit the most from omitting frame pointers?
//!   They also suffer the most from doing so, because of ancient unwinding/backtrace handling:
//!   - <https://github.com/rust-lang/backtrace-rs/pull/624#issuecomment-2109962234>
//!   - <https://github.com/rust-lang/backtrace-rs/pull/584#issuecomment-1952006125>
//!   - <https://github.com/rust-lang/backtrace-rs/pull/601>
//!   - <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/3f1d3948d6d434b34dd47f132c126a6cb6b8a4ab>
//! - Omitting frame-pointers may not meaningfully impact -Cpanic=abort binaries in function, but
//!   some targets that default to panic=abort do force frame pointers to allow debugging to work,
//!   even when they are notably pressed for space:
//!   - <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b71e8cbaf2c7cae4d36898fff1d0ba19d9233082/compiler/rustc_target/src/spec/base/thumb.rs#L51-L53>
//! - There is, of course, the question of whether this compiler option was ever a good idea?
//!   Some would say no: <https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2024-03-17/the-return-of-the-frame-pointers.html>
//! - Despite all other remarks, it is true that the previous behavior was to defer to the CLI!
//!   There is a regression, the only question is perhaps some platforms rely on that "regression"
//!   The current behavior technically upholds the doc's "without reading the source" contract, but
//!   is unfaithful in spirit:
//!   - <https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/9e7aff794539aa040362f4424eb29207449ffce0/src/doc/rustc/src/codegen-options/index.md?plain=1#L157-L165>
//!
//! A partial thought: Perhaps
//! - A -Cpanic=abort binary could prefer the CLI's setting, like previously done?
//! - A -Cpanic=unwind binary should use the current "take highest" behavior?
